# Custom QMK firmware keyboard and keymap for artseyio paintbrush keyboard

I purchased the Paintbrush kit from [keebd.com](https://keebd.com/products/paintbrush-keyboard-kit) with the Helios rp2040 controller. The provided firmware is way out of date and doesn't seem to work outside of the home keys, so I built up my own firmware borrowing from the [artseyio github](https://github.com/artseyio/artsey-qmk).

Currently, the board is functional and supports all the combos and layers. I have yet to get the oled functional.
